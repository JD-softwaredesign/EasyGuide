### Background

Nearly everyone experienced with technology has had the often frustrating experience of helping an less tech-savvy user navigate the web. Even power users can get lost in labyrinthine menus looking for specific settings or features. Enter EasyGuide: Simply hit record to have the extension record a series of clicks, and then save them to play back at any time, highlighting each clicked element in turn as the user walks through the steps.

### How To Use

Install the extension from the Chrome store. Click the flag icon in your browser's toolbar, and click the red record button to start a new Guide. Navigate the web as you normally would until you've completed the task you would like to demonstrate, then click the flag icon again and click stop. You will be prompted to enter a name and save your Guide, or cancel to delete it. Then, click the flag again and click the Guide name in the list of Guides to start playback.
